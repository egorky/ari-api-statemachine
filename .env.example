# Set to "true" to disable, "false" or leave unset to enable.
DISABLE_WEB_UI="false"

# --- Notes ---
# For boolean flags like DISABLE_WEB_UI and DISABLE_ARI, the application typically checks for the string "true".
# Any other value (or if the variable is unset) will usually result in the feature being enabled.
# Always use strong, unique values for secrets like API_TOKEN, WEB_PASSWORD, and SESSION_SECRET in production.
